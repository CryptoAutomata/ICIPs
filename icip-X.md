This is the suggested template for new ICIPs.

Note that an ICIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your ICIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `ICIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ICIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for ICIPs that want to change the ICON protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the ICIP solves. ICIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Action plan
The action plans are critical for ICIPs to be taken seriously and potentially implemented. List out the to-dos without being vague, especially if you need additional resources from the community or the team. Be precise about how you plan to achieve the goal.

## Resource plan
Explain the resources required for this proposal, preferably including a timeline projection. Remember we're dedicating our time to your plan, we will need to know your expectations from us.
