## Simple Summary
The ICON Community Alliance hx57 will collaborate with Panel to launch ICON Research Week - a week where content will be created by the community and the Panel team.

## Intro
Welcome to Panel x hx57 ICON Research Week!
Anyone who would be interested, can contribute and we will work together to structure the content into something the community will appreciate and learn from. The panel team has prepared some prompts that the research will focus on - if any of the prompts speak to you, or if you have something else you’d like to write about, this is your platform for getting your passion & message about ICON to the rest of the ICON community. Feel free to view, suggest edits, create new content, & comment on old content. 

We’re excited to have a content-packed, educational, and fun research week! The panel team has been hard at work at porting over their ICON research. We have secured some big Toronto names to be featured in a community podcast as well.

Feel free to talk with us on telegram [@hellopanel](https://t.me/hellopanel), or through [ICON Community Alliance hx57](https://t.me/iconhx57) telegram channel.
