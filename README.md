# ICIPs 
ICON Community Improvement Proposals (ICIPs) describe community initiatives toward the ICON project, including education, marketing, public relations, local representation, community outreach and other business development opportunities.

# Steps to Evaluate 

 1. Visit our public channel [ICON Community Alliance HX57](https://t.me/iconhx57), introduce your proposal.
 2. Seek for the resources required. Eg. I need a Chinese translator for an ICON article I wrote.
 
 If you believe the proposal has popular consensus among the community and you have the necessary resources in place to implement, you can change the status to accepted and make a pull request (alternatively email to 2infiniti@gmail.com) 

# ICIP Status 
* **Draft** - an ICIP that is open for consideration.
* **Accepted** - an ICIP that is planned for immediate implementation
* **Final** - an ICIP that has been implemented
* **Deferred** - an ICIP that is not being considered for immediate implementation but may be reconsidered in the future.

# ICIP Type
* **Community** - only community resources required
* **Hybrid** - will require some of team's help to some extent
* **Team** - proposed for team's evaluation

# Technical 
If your ICIP requires images, the image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that ICIP as follows: `assets/ICIP-X` (for ICIP **X**). When linking to an image in the ICIP, use relative links such as `../assets/ICIP-X/image.png`.
